# notes

> This `notes` repo is automatically generated from a private `notes-source` repo using the Hugo static site generator. 

For instructions on how to use Hugo and GitHub Pages to host your content for free, see [Create and Host a Blog for Free (~1 hour)](https://denisecase.github.io/notes/post/2022-01-01-publish/)).

The linked article shows how to create:

- a private repo (e.g., [notes-source](https://github.com/denisecase/notes-source))
- a public repo (e.g., [notes](https://github.com/denisecase/notes))

The private repo is what we use while writing and developing the site. This public repo gets automatically generated using Hugo and GitHub Actions. 
This public repo hosts the site for free using GitHub Pages.

The [`notes-source-example`](https://github.com/denisecase/notes-source-example) repo is not used - it just displays files used in the private repo.
